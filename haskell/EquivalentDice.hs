-- -- Equivalent Dice

-- A 5th kyu problem posed by codewars.com:
-- https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b26047b9e40b9f4ec00002b

-- With one die of 6 sides we will have six different possible results:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 .

-- With 2 dice of six sides, we will have 36 different possible results:

-- (1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(3,1),(1,4),(4,1),(1,5),
-- (5,1), (1,6),(6,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(2,4),(4,2),
-- (2,5),(5,2)(2,6),(6,2),(3,3),(3,4),(4,3),(3,5),(5,3),
-- (3,6),(6,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(4,6),(6,4),(5,5),
-- (5,6),(6,5),(6,6)

-- So, with 2 dice of 6 sides we get 36 different events.

-- ([6,6] ---> 36)

-- But with 2 different dice we can get for this case, the same number of events. One die of 4 sides and another of 9 sides will produce the exact amount of events.

-- ([4,9] ---> 36)

-- We say that the dice set [4,9] is equivalent to [6,6] because both produce the same number of events.

-- Also we may have an amount of three dice producing the same amount of events. It will be for:

-- [4,3,3] ---> 36

-- (One die of 4 sides and two dice of 3 sides each)

-- Perhaps you may think that the following set is equivalent: [6,3,2] but unfortunately dice have a minimum of three sides (well, really a tetrahedron with one empty side)

-- The task for this kata is to get the amount of equivalent dice sets, having 2 dice at least,for a given set.

-- For example, for the previous case: [6,6] we will have 3 equivalent sets that are:  [4, 3, 3], [12, 3], [9, 4] .

-- You may assume that dice are available from 3 and above for any value up to an icosahedral die (20 sides).

-- [5,6,4] ---> 5 (they are [10, 4, 3], [8, 5, 3], [20, 6], [15, 8], [12, 10])

-- For the cases we cannot get any equivalent set the result will be 0. For example for the set [3,3] we will not have equivalent dice.

-- Range of inputs for Random Tests:

-- 3 <= sides <= 15
-- 2 <= dices <= 7

-- OK, so it's pretty obvious that this is about products/factors.
-- For a set of dice (x, y, z, ...), the number of possible results is the product of the number of sides of each die.
-- And inversely, for a given number of possible results, an equivalent set is any factorisation of that number.
-- The part I'm not sure about is how to count the number of combinations of those factors, without just working out all the factorisations.

-- We also need to exlcude the case where the number of sides is less than 3, etc
-- And subtract the initial set from the count
