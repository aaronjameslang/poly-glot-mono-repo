# Rust

Rust is a general-purpose programming language. It is noted for its emphasis on
performance, type safety, concurrency, and memory safety.

Rust supports multiple programming paradigms. It was influenced by ideas from
functional programming, including immutability, higher-order functions,
algebraic data types, and pattern matching. It also supports object-oriented
programming via structs, enums, traits, and methods. Rust is noted for enforcing
memory safety (i.e., that all references point to valid memory) without a
conventional garbage collector; instead, memory safety errors and data races are
prevented by the "borrow checker", which tracks the object lifetime of
references at compile time.

## Getting started

Install rust, e.g. `brew install rust`

If you see `Cargo.toml` you can try `cargo test` and/or `cargo run`
